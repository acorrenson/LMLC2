# LMLC2
LambdaMLCompiler is a transpiler of a subset of Caml toward the Î»-calculus.

# Type inference
Thanks to OCaml, this one has a type checker, which didn't have the version coded in C.

# Proof
This compiler will (hopefully) be proven in Coq, the actual version (in the folder LMLCv2) isn't proved but resembles the output of the code extraction once/if it will be proved.
